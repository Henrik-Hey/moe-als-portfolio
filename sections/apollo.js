                Re-brand Apollo completely. Some design elements are there, but
                changes are needed to make the application look more modern,
                up-to-date, and user-friendly.

                Apollo allows users to teach and learn classes online at no
                cost. Itâ€™s a modern tool that can be used to learn new skills
                and hobbies every day.
