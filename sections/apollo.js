                Re brand Apollo completely, some design elements are there, but
                changes are needed to make the application look more modern, up
                to date, and user-friendly.

                Apollo allows users to teach, and learn classes online at no
                cost, itâ€™s a modern tool that can be used to learn new skills
                and hobbies every day.
