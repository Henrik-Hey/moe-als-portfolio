                Create a mobile / web application for skateboarders who are
                interested in creating a social platform where they can meet
                likeminded people and discuss similar topics.
                <br />
                <br />
                Users can choose if theyâ€™d like to revolve their account around
                art and selling products as a business, or they could take the
                more standard approach and grow to be a huge media star, either
                way - Pochui is a platform for everyone!
